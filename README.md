- Used Power Query to clean and structure the dataset.
- Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized formats.

**✅ Descriptive Analysis:**
- Summarized key sales metrics (total revenue, average sales, growth rates, etc.).
- Created pivot tables for category-wise and region-wise analysis.

**✅ Regression & Forecasting:**
