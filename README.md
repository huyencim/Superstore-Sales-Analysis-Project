- **R** (Linear Regression)
- **Excel** (Logistic Regression)

## 📊 Key Features

✅ **Data Cleaning & Preparation:**

- Used Power Query to clean and structure the dataset.
- Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized formats.

✅ **Descriptive Analysis:**

- Summarized key sales metrics (total revenue, average sales, growth rates, etc.).
